## 🧠 Research Interests
Private Edge Computing · Federated Learning on Routers ·  
QoS-Aware Web Service Optimization · Distributed Systems · Edge Intelligence

My research focuses on leveraging **home routers and WiFi access points** as localized, user-controlled compute nodes to complement cloud and public edge infrastructures. I design systems and algorithms that enable **low-latency, privacy-preserving, and resource-efficient computation** at the network edge.
